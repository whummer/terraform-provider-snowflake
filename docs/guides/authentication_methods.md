# Authentication methods

This guide focuses on providing an example on every authentication method available in the provider.
Each method includes steps for setting dependencies, like MFA app, and getting encrypted/unencrypted keys.
For now, we provide examples for the most common use cases.
The rest of the options (Okta, ExternalBrowser, TokenAccessor) are planned to be added later on.

## Authentication flows

### Snowflake authenticator flow (login + password)

Provider setup in this case is pretty straightforward:

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
  organization_name = "<organization_name>"
  account_name      = "<account_name>"
  user              = "<user_name>"
  password          = var.password
}

variable "password" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}
```

You can then set Terraform variables like:
- If a variable does not have any value set, you will be prompted by Terraform to provide the value.
- Use Terraform VAR environment variables: `TF_VAR_password="<key>" terraform plan`
- Use Terraform flags: `terraform plan -var="private_key=<key>"`
- Use Snowflake Terraform Provider flags: `SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY="<key>" terraform plan`

Remember to load `<key>` from a secure location, instead of hardcoding the value.

Without passing any authenticator, we depend on the underlying Go Snowflake driver and Snowflake itself to fill this field out.
This means that we do not provision the default, and it may change at some point, so if you want to be explicit, you can define Snowflake authenticator like so:

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
  organization_name = "<organization_name>"
  account_name      = "<account_name>"
  user              = "<user_name>"
  password          = var.password
  authenticator     = "Snowflake"
}

variable "password" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}
```

### PAT (Personal Access Token)

You must fulfill the following prerequisites to generate and use programmatic access tokens:
- [Network policy requirements](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/programmatic-access-tokens#label-pat-prerequisites-network)
- [Authentication policy requirements](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/programmatic-access-tokens#label-pat-prerequisites-authentication)

#### Managing PATs

Managing the whole PAT lifecycle is implemented in the provider with the [snowflake_programmatic_access_token](../resources/user_programmatic_access_token) resource.
For example, to create a new PAT, you can use the following code:
```terraform
resource "snowflake_user_programmatic_access_token" "example" {
  user = snowflake_user.user.name
  name = "TOKEN"
}
```

You can also rotate the PAT by using the `keeper` attribute and connecting it to a resource providing changing a value, like [time_rotating](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/time/latest/docs/resources/rotating) resource from the `time` provider.
See the example setup below.

```terraform
# note this requires the terraform to be run regularly
resource "time_rotating" "rotation_schedule" {
  rotation_days = 30
}

resource "snowflake_user_programmatic_access_token" "example" {
  user = snowflake_user.user.name
  name = "TOKEN"

  # Use the keeper field to force token rotation. If, and only if, the value changes
  # from a non-empty to a different non-empty value, the token will be rotated.
  # When you add this key or remove this key from the config, the token will not be rotated.
  # When the token is rotated, the `token` and `rotated_token_name` fields are marked as computed.
  keeper = time_rotating.rotation_schedule.rotation_rfc3339
}
```
Note that in this example, the rotation occurs only when you execute a `terraform apply` command.
After 30 days pass, you will see a plan output similar to:
```
time_rotating.rotation_schedule: Refreshing state... [id=2025-07-22T08:06:51Z]
snowflake_user_programmatic_access_token.complete_with_external_references: Refreshing state... [id="PAT"|"TOKEN"]

Note: Objects have changed outside of Terraform

Terraform detected the following changes made outside of Terraform since the last "terraform apply" which may have affected this plan:

  # time_rotating.rotation_schedule has been deleted
  - resource "time_rotating" "rotation_schedule" {
        id               = "2025-07-22T08:06:51Z"
      - rfc3339          = "2025-07-22T08:06:51Z" -> null
        # (9 unchanged attributes hidden)
    }


Unless you have made equivalent changes to your configuration, or ignored the relevant attributes using ignore_changes, the following plan may include actions to undo or respond to
these changes.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
  ~ update in-place

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # snowflake_user_programmatic_access_token.complete_with_external_references will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "snowflake_user_programmatic_access_token" "complete_with_external_references" {
        id                                        = "\"PAT\"|\"TOKEN\""
      ~ keeper                                    = "2025-07-22T08:06:51Z" -> (known after apply)
        name                                      = "TOKEN"
      + rotated_token_name                        = (known after apply)
      ~ token                                     = (sensitive value)
        # (8 unchanged attributes hidden)
    }

  # time_rotating.rotation_schedule will be created
  + resource "time_rotating" "rotation_schedule" {
      + day              = 30
      + hour             = (known after apply)
      + id               = (known after apply)
      + minute           = (known after apply)
      + month            = (known after apply)
      + rfc3339          = (known after apply)
      + rotation_minutes = (known after apply)
      + rotation_rfc3339 = (known after apply)
      + second           = (known after apply)
      + unix             = (known after apply)
      + year             = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

If you do not want to manage PATs in Terraform, you can simply use a special [ALTER USER](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-user-add-programmatic-access-token) command.
It will generate a new token and return it in the output console.

#### Authenticating with PATs

To use PATs in the provider, you have the following options:
- Follow the [user + password](#snowflake-authenticator-flow-login--password) authentication workflow,
but instead of password, use the generated token.
- Use the `PROGRAMMATIC_ACCESS_TOKEN` authenticator and pass the generated token in the `token` field, like:
```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
  organization_name = "<organization_name>"
  account_name      = "<account_name>"
  user              = "<user_name>"
  authenticator     = "PROGRAMMATIC_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  token             = var.token
}

variable "token" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}
```

See [Snowflake official documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/programmatic-access-tokens) for more information on PAT authentication.

### JWT authenticator flow

To use JWT authentication, you have to firstly generate key-pairs used by Snowflake.
To correctly generate the necessary keys, follow [this guide](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth#configuring-key-pair-authentication) from the official Snowflake documentation.
After you [set the generated public key](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth#assign-the-public-key-to-a-snowflake-user) to the Terraform user and [verify it](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth#verify-the-user-s-public-key-fingerprint),
you can proceed with the following provider configuration:

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
  organization_name = "<organization_name>"
  account_name      = "<account_name>"
  user              = "<user_name>"
  authenticator     = "SNOWFLAKE_JWT"
  private_key       = file("~/.ssh/snowflake_private_key.p8")
  # Optionally, set it with Terraform variable.
  private_key       = var.private_key
}

variable "private_key" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}
```

To load the private key you can utilize the built-in [file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/file) function.
If you have any issues with this method, one of the possible root causes could be an additional newline at the end of the file that causes error in the underlying Go Snowflake driver.
If this doesn't help, you can try other methods of supplying this field:
- Filling the key directly by using [multi-string notation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/strings#heredoc-strings) (not recommended).
- Sourcing it from the environment variable:
```shell
export SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat ~/.ssh/snowflake_private_key.p8)
# Or inline the value (not recommended).
export SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----..."
```
- Using TOML configuration file:
```toml
[default]
private_key = "..."
```

In case of any other issues, take a look at related topics:
- https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3332#issuecomment-2618957814
- https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3350#issuecomment-2604851052

#### JWT authenticator flow using passphrase

If you would like to use key-pair utilizing passphrase, you can add it to the configuration like so:

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
  organization_name      = "<organization_name>"
  account_name           = "<account_name>"
  user                   = "<user_name>"
  authenticator          = "SNOWFLAKE_JWT"
  private_key            = file("~/.ssh/snowflake_private_key.p8")
  private_key_passphrase = var.private_key_passphrase
}

variable "private_key_passphrase" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}
```

### MFA authenticator flow

Before being able to log in with MFA method, you have to prepare your Terraform user by following [this guide](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-mfa) in the official Snowflake documentation.
Once MFA is set up on your Terraform user, you can use one of the following configurations.
Choosing the configuration depends on the preferred confirmation method (push notification or passcode) and the one that is available (not always both options are available).

The configuration that uses push notification:

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
  organization_name = "<organization_name>"
  account_name      = "<account_name>"
  user              = "<user_name>"
  password          = var.password
  authenticator     = "UsernamePasswordMFA"
}

variable "password" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}
```

and the configuration that uses passcode:

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
  organization_name = "<organization_name>"
  account_name      = "<account_name>"
  user              = "<user_name>"
  password          = var.password
  authenticator     = "UsernamePasswordMFA"
  passcode          = "000000"
}

variable "password" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}
```

#### MFA token caching

MFA token caching can help to reduce the number of prompts that must be acknowledged while connecting and authenticating to Snowflake, especially when multiple connection attempts are made within a relatively short time interval.
Follow [this guide](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-mfa#using-mfa-token-caching-to-minimize-the-number-of-prompts-during-authentication-optional) to enable it.

### Okta authenticator flow

To set up a new Okta account for this flow, follow [this guide](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/b863d2e79ae6ae021552c4348e3012b8053ede17/pkg/manual_tests/authentication_methods/README.md#okta-authenticator-test).
If you already have an Okta account, skip the first point and follow the next steps.
The guide includes writing the provider configuration in the TOML file, but here's what it should look like fully in HCL:

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
  organization_name = "<organization_name>"
  account_name      = "<account_name>"
  user              = "<user_name>"
  password          = var.password
  authenticator     = "Okta"
  okta_url          = "https://dev-123456.okta.com"
}

variable "password" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}
```

## Common issues

### How can I get my organization name?

If you are logged into account that is in the same organization as Terraform user (or logged in as Terraform user), you can run:
```snowflake
SELECT CURRENT_ORGANIZATION_NAME();
```
The output of this command is your `<organization_name>`.

### How can I get my account name?

If you are logged into as a user that is in the same account as Terraform user (or logged in as Terraform user), you can run:
```snowflake
SELECT CURRENT_ACCOUNT_NAME();
```
The output of this command is your `<account_name>`.

## General recommendations

### Be sure you are passing all the required fields

This point is not only referring to double-checking the fields you are passing, but also to inform you that depending on the account
you want to log into, a different set of parameters may be required.

Whenever you are on a Snowflake deployment that has different url than the default one:
`<organization_name>-<account_name>.snowflakecomputing.com`, you may encounter errors similar to:

```text
open snowflake connection: 261004 (08004): failed to auth for unknown reason.
```

This error can be raised for a number of reasons, but explicitly specifying the host has effectively prevented such occurrences so far.
