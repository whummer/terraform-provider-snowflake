## Support

For official support and urgent, production-impacting issues, please [contact Snowflake Support](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/How-To-Submit-a-Support-Case-in-Snowflake-Lodge).

~> **Keep in mind** that the official support starts with the [v2.0.0](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.0.0) version for stable resources only. All previous versions and preview resources are not officially supported. Also, consult [supported architectures](#supported-architectures).

Please follow [creating issues guidelines](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/CREATING_ISSUES.md), [FAQ](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/FAQ.md), and [known issues](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) before submitting an issue on GitHub or directly to Snowflake Support.

# Snowflake Provider

~> **Disclaimer** The project is in GA version, but some features are in preview. Such resources and data sources are considered preview features in the provider, regardless of their state in Snowflake. We do not guarantee their stability. They will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes in these features are expected, even without bumping the major version. They are disabled by default. To use them, add the relevant feature name to `preview_features_enabled` field in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#schema). The list of preview features is available below. Please always refer to the [Getting Help](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-help) section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.

~> **Note** Please check the [migration guide](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) when changing the version of the provider.

!> **Sensitive values** Important: Do not include credentials, personal identifiers, or other regulated or sensitive information (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS data) in non-sensitive fields. Snowflake marks specific fields as sensitive—such as passwords, private keys, and tokens, meaning these fields will not appear in logs. Each sensitive field is properly marked in the documentation. All other fields are treated as non-sensitive by default. Some of them, like [task's](./resources/task) configuration, may contain sensitive information but are not marked as sensitive - you are responsible for safeguarding these fields according to your organization's security standards and regulatory requirements. Snowflake will not be liable for any exposure of data placed in non-sensitive fields. Read more in the [Sensitive values limitations](#sensitive-values-limitations) section.

-> **Note** The current roadmap is available in our GitHub repository: [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md).

This is a terraform provider plugin for managing [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) accounts.
Coverage is focused on part of Snowflake related to access control.

## Supported architectures

We have compiled a list to clarify which binaries are officially supported and which are provided additionally but not officially supported.
The lists are based on what the underlying [gosnowflake driver](https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake) supports and what [HashiCorp recommends for Terraform providers](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/providers/os-arch).

The provider officially supports the binaries built for the following OSes and architectures:
- Windows: amd64
- Linux: amd64 and arm64
- Darwin: amd64 and arm64

Currently, we also provide the binaries for the following OSes and architectures, but they are not officially supported, and we do not prioritize fixes for them:
- Windows: arm64 and 386
- Linux: 386
- Darwin: 386
- Freebsd: any architecture

## Example Provider Configuration

This is an example configuration of the provider in `main.tf` in a configuration directory. More examples are provided [below](#order-precedence).

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    snowflake = {
      source = "snowflakedb/snowflake"
    }
  }
}

# A simple configuration of the provider with a default authentication.
# A default value for `authenticator` is `snowflake`, enabling authentication with `user` and `password`.
provider "snowflake" {
  organization_name = "..." # required if not using profile. Can also be set via SNOWFLAKE_ORGANIZATION_NAME env var
  account_name      = "..." # required if not using profile. Can also be set via SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_NAME env var
  user              = "..." # required if not using profile or token. Can also be set via SNOWFLAKE_USER env var
  password          = "..."

  // optional
  role      = "..."
  host      = "..."
  warehouse = "..."
  params = {
    query_tag = "..."
  }
}

# A simple configuration of the provider with private key authentication.
provider "snowflake" {
  organization_name      = "..." # required if not using profile. Can also be set via SNOWFLAKE_ORGANIZATION_NAME env var
  account_name           = "..." # required if not using profile. Can also be set via SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_NAME env var
  user                   = "..." # required if not using profile or token. Can also be set via SNOWFLAKE_USER env var
  authenticator          = "SNOWFLAKE_JWT"
  private_key            = file("~/.ssh/snowflake_key.p8")
  private_key_passphrase = var.private_key_passphrase
}

# Remember to provide the passphrase securely.
variable "private_key_passphrase" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

# By using the `profile` field, missing fields will be populated from ~/.snowflake/config TOML file
provider "snowflake" {
  profile = "securityadmin"
}
```

## Configuration Schema

**Warning: these values are passed directly to the gosnowflake library, which may not work exactly the way you expect. See the [gosnowflake docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake#hdr-Connection_Parameters) for more.**

-> **Note**: In Go Snowflake driver 1.12.1 ([release notes](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/clients-drivers/golang-2024#version-1-12-1-december-05-2024)), configuration field `InsecureMode` has been deprecated in favor of `DisableOCSPChecks`. This field is not available in the provider yet. Please use `InsecureMode` instead, which has the same behavior. We are planning to support this new field and deprecate the old one.

-> **Note** If a field has a default value, it is shown next to the type in the schema. Most of the values in provider schema can be sourced from environment value (check field descriptions), but If a specified environment variable is not found, then the driver's default value is used instead.

## Authentication

The Snowflake provider supports multiple ways to authenticate:

* Password
* PAT (Personal Access Token)
* OAuth Access Token
* OAuth Refresh Token
* Browser Auth
* Private Key
* Config File

In all cases `organization_name`, `account_name` and `user` are required.

-> **Note** Storing the credentials and other secret values safely is on the users' side. Read more in [Authentication Methods guide](./guides/authentication_methods).

### Keypair Authentication Environment Variables

You should generate the public and private keys and set up environment variables.

```shell

cd ~/.ssh
openssl genrsa -out snowflake_key 4096
openssl rsa -in snowflake_key -pubout -out snowflake_key.pub
```

To export the variables into your provider:

```shell
export SNOWFLAKE_USER="..."
export SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat ~/.ssh/snowflake_key.p8)
```

### Keypair Authentication Passphrase

If your private key requires a passphrase, then this can be supplied via the
environment variable `SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE`.

Only the ciphers aes-128-cbc, aes-128-gcm, aes-192-cbc, aes-192-gcm,
aes-256-cbc, aes-256-gcm, and des-ede3-cbc are supported on the private key

```shell
cd ~/.ssh
openssl genrsa -out snowflake_key 4096
openssl rsa -in snowflake_key -pubout -out snowflake_key.pub
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform pem -in snowflake_key -outform PEM -v2 aes-256-cbc -out snowflake_key.p8
```

To export the variables into your provider:

```shell
export SNOWFLAKE_USER="..."
export SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat ~/.ssh/snowflake_key.p8)
export SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE="..."
```

### OAuth Access Token

If you have an OAuth access token, export these credentials as environment variables:

```shell
export SNOWFLAKE_USER='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN='...'
```

Note that once this access token expires, you'll need to request a new one through an external application.

### OAuth Refresh Token

If you have an OAuth Refresh token, export these credentials as environment variables:

```shell
export SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN_ACCESSOR_REFRESH_TOKEN='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN_ACCESSOR_CLIENT_ID='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN_ACCESSOR_CLIENT_SECRET='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN_ACCESSOR_TOKEN_ENDPOINT='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN_ACCESSOR_REDIRECT_URI='https://localhost.com'
```

Note because access token have a short life; typically 10 minutes, by passing refresh token new access token will be generated.

### Username and Password Environment Variables

If you choose to use Username and Password Authentication, export these credentials:

```shell
export SNOWFLAKE_USER='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD='...'
```

## Order Precedence

Currently, the provider can be configured in three ways:
1. In a Terraform file located in the Terraform module with other resources.
2. In environmental variables (envs). This is mainly used to provide sensitive values.
3. In a TOML file (default in ~/.snowflake/config).

### Terraform file located in the Terraform module with other resources
One of the methods of configuring the provider is in the Terraform module. Read more in the [Terraform docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/configuration).

Example content of the Terraform file configuration:

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
    organization_name = "..."
    account_name = "..."
    username = "..."
    password = "..."
}
```

### Environmental variables
The second method is to use environmental variables. This is mainly used to provide sensitive values.

```bash
export SNOWFLAKE_USER="..."
export SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat ~/.ssh/snowflake_key.p8)
```

### TOML file
The third method is to use a TOML configuration file (default location in ~/.snowflake/config). Notice the use of different profiles. The profile name needs to be specified in the Terraform configuration file in `profile` field. When this is not specified, `default` profile is loaded.
When a `default` profile is not present in the TOML file, it is treated as "empty", without failing.

Read [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) specification for more details on the syntax.

Example content of the Terraform file configuration:

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
    profile = "default"
}
```

Example content of the TOML file configuration is listed below. Note that this example follows a new TOML format, for the legacy format see [examples](#examples) section.

```toml
[default]
organization_name='organization_name'
account_name='account_name'
user='user'
password='password'
role='ACCOUNTADMIN'

[secondary_test_account]
organization_name='organization_name'
account_name='account2_name'
user='user'
password='password'
role='ACCOUNTADMIN'
```

#### TOML file limitations
To ensure a better security of the provider, the following limitations are introduced:

-> **Note**: TOML file size is limited to 10MB.

-> **Note**: Only TOML file with restricted privileges can be read. Any privileges for group or others cannot be set (the maximum valid privilege is `700`). You can set the expected privileges like `chmod 0600 ~/.snowflake/config`. This is checked only on non-Windows platforms. If you are using the provider on Windows, please make sure that your configuration file has not too permissive privileges.

### Source Hierarchy
Not all fields must be configured in one source; users can choose which fields are configured in which source.
Provider uses an established hierarchy of sources. The current behavior is that for each field:
1. Check if it is present in the provider configuration. If yes, use this value. If not, go to step 2.
1. Check if it is present in the environment variables. If yes, use this value. If not, go to step 3.
1. Check if it is present in the TOML config file (specifically, use the profile name configured in one of the steps above). If yes, use this value. If not, the value is considered empty.

-> **Note** Currently `private_key` and `private_key_passphrase` are coupled and must be set in one source (both on Terraform side or both in TOML config, see https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3332). This will be fixed in the future.

-> **Note** Currently both legacy and new formats are supported. The new format can be enabled with setting `use_legacy_toml_file = false` in the provider configuration. We encourage using the new format for now, as it will be a default one in v2 version of the provider. The differences between these formats are:
- The keys in the provider contain an underscore (`_`) as a separator, but the TOML schema has fields without any separator.
- The field `driver_tracing` in the provider is related to `tracing` in the TOML schema.

### Examples

An example new TOML file contents:

```toml
[example]
account_name = 'account_name'

## Sensitive values limitations

The provider marks fields containing access credentials and other such information as sensitive. This means that the values of these fields will not be logged.

There are some limitations to this mechanism:
- Sensitive values are stored as plaintext in the state file. This is a limitation of Terraform itself ([reference](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/sensitive-variables#sensitive-values-in-state)). You should take care to secure access to the state file.
- In [Plugin SDK](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2) there is no possibility to mark sensitive values conditionally ([reference](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/736)). This means it is not possible to mark sensitive values based on other fields, like marking `body` based on the value of `secure` field in views, functions, and procedures. As a result, this field is not marked as sensitive. For such cases, we add disclaimers in the resource documentation.
- In Plugin SDK, there is no possibility to mark sensitive values in nested fields ([reference](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/201)). This means the nested fields, like these in `show_output` and `describe_output` cannot be sensitive.
As a result, such nested fields are not marked as sensitive. For such cases, we add disclaimers in the resource documentation. Additionally, some fields are missing from `show_output` and `describe_output`. However, these fields are present in the resource's root, so they can still be referenced.
The alternative solution we considered was setting the whole `show_output` and `describe_output` as sensitive. However, this solution could reduce the provider functionality and would require changes in user's configurations.

As a general rule, please ensure that no personal data, sensitive data, export-controlled data, or other regulated data is entered as metadata when using the provider. If you use one of these fields, they may be present in logs, so ensure that the provider logs are properly restricted. For more information, see [Sensitive values limitations](../#sensitive-values-limitations) and [Metadata fields in Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/metadata).

Read more about sensitive values in the [Terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/sensitive-variables).

We are planning to research migration to Plugin Framework and we will investigate if the limitations coming from Plugin SDK can be addressed.

## Features

### Operation Timeouts
By default, Terraform sets resource operation timeouts to 20 minutes ([reference](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts#default-timeouts-and-deadline-exceeded-errors)). Now, the provider enables configuration of these values by users in `timeouts` block in each resource.
The default timeouts are in general aligned with the Terraform defaults. If a resource has different timeouts, it is specified in the resource documentation.

Data sources will be supported in the future.
Read more in following [official documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts)).

You can specify the timeouts like the following:
```terraform

resource "snowflake_execute" "test" {
  execute = "CREATE DATABASE ABC"
  revert  = "DROP DATABASE ABC"
  query   = "SHOW DATABASES LIKE '%ABC%'"

  timeouts {
    create = "10m"
    read   = "10m"
    update = "10m"
    delete = "10m"
  }
}
```

-> Note: Timeouts can be also set at driver's level (see [driver documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake)). These timeouts are independent. We recommend tweaking the timeouts on Terraform level first.

## A list of preview and stable resources and data sources

The provider supports a number of Snowflake features. Within the provider, some features are stable, while others are in preview
(stability of the feature in the provider is not connected to the stability of the feature in Snowflake).

Preview features are **experimental** and may introduce **breaking changes**, even between non-major versions of the provider.
Eventually, every preview resource will be promoted to stable, but the timeline for each feature is not defined (you can find more details on the current/future plans in [our roadmap](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)).
New resources will be introduced as preview ones and promoted over time to stable as we gain more confidence in their stability.

Preview features are disabled by default and should be used with caution.
To use them, add the relevant feature name to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the [provider configuration](#preview_features_enabled-1).
