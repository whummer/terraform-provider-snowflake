!> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `preview_features_enabled` field in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#schema). Please always refer to the [Getting Help](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-help) section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.

-> **Note** Managing service state is limited. It is handled by `auto_suspend_secs`, and `auto_resume` fields. The provider does not support managing the state of services in Snowflake with `ALTER ... SUSPEND` and `ALTER ... RESUME`. See [Suspending a service documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-services#suspending-a-service) for more details.

-> **Note** During resource deletion and recreation, the provider uses `DROP SERVICE` with `FORCE` option to properly handle services with block storage volumes. Read more in [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/drop-service#force-option).

## Example Usage

-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->

-> **Note** If a field has a default value, it is shown next to the type in the schema.
